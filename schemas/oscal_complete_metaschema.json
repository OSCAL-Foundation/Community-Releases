      "description" : "A partition of an assessment plan or results or a child of another part.\n\nA `part` provides for logical partitioning of prose, and can be thought of as a grouping structure (e.g., section). A `part` can have child parts allowing for arbitrary nesting of prose content (e.g., statement hierarchy). A `part` can contain `prop` objects that allow for enriching prose text with structured name/value information.\n\nA `part` can be assigned an optional `id`, which allows for internal and external references to the textual concept contained within a `part`. A `id` provides a means for an OSCAL profile, or a higher layer OSCAL model to reference a specific part within a `catalog`. For example, an `id` can be used to reference or to make modifications to a control statement in a profile.\n\nUse of `part` and `prop` provides for a wide degree of extensibility within the OSCAL catalog model. The optional `ns` provides a means to qualify a part's `name`, allowing for organization-specific vocabularies to be defined with clear semantics. Any organization that extends OSCAL in this way should consistently assign a `ns` value that represents the organization, making a given namespace qualified `name` unique to that organization. This allows the combination of `ns` and `name` to always be unique and unambiguous, even when mixed with extensions from other organizations. Each organization is responsible for governance of their own extensions, and is strongly encouraged to publish their extensions as standards to their user community. If no `ns` is provided, the name is expected to be in the \"OSCAL\" namespace.\n\nTo ensure a `ns` is unique to an organization and naming conflicts are avoided, a URI containing a DNS or other globally defined organization name should be used. For example, if FedRAMP and DoD both extend OSCAL, FedRAMP will use the `ns` `http://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal`, while DoD might use the `ns` `https://defense.gov` for any organization specific `name`.\n\nTools that process OSCAL content are not required to interpret unrecognized OSCAL extensions; however, OSCAL compliant tools should not modify or remove unrecognized extensions, unless there is a compelling reason to do so, such as data sensitivity.",

Controls may be as complex or as simple as a catalog defines them. They may be decomposed or further specified into child `control` objects, for example to represent control enhancements or specific breakouts of control functionality, to be maintained as discrete requirements. Controls may also contain structured parts (using `part`) and they may be grouped together in families or classes with `group`.\n\nControl structures in OSCAL will also exhibit regularities and rules that are not codified in OSCAL but in its applications or domains of application. For example, for catalogs describing controls as defined by NIST SP 800-53, a control must have a part with the name \"statement\", which represents the textual narrative of the control. This \"statement\" part must occur only once, but may have nested parts to allow for multiple paragraphs or sections of text. This organization supports addressability of this data content as long as, and only insofar as, it is consistently implemented across the control set. As given with these model definitions, constraints defined and assigned here can aid in ensuring this regularity; but other such constraints and other useful patterns of use remain to be discovered and described.",

A `part` can have child parts allowing for arbitrary nesting of prose content (e.g., statement hierarchy). A `part` can contain `prop` objects that allow for enriching prose text with structured name/value information.\n\nA `part` can be assigned an optional `id`, which allows references to this part from within a catalog, or within an instance of another OSCAL model that has a need to reference the part. Examples of where part referencing is used in OSCAL include:\n\n- Referencing a part by id to tailor (make modifications to) a control statement in a profile.\n- Referencing a control statement represented by a part in a system security plan implemented-requirement where a statement-level response is desired.\n\nUse of `part` and `prop` provides for a wide degree of extensibility within the OSCAL catalog model. The optional `ns` provides a means to qualify a part's `name`, allowing for organization-specific vocabularies to be defined with clear semantics. Any organization that extends OSCAL in this way should consistently assign a `ns` value that represents the organization, making a given namespace qualified `name` unique to that organization. This allows the combination of `ns` and `name` to always be unique and unambiguous, even when mixed with extensions from other organizations. Each organization is responsible for governance of their own extensions, and is strongly encouraged to publish their extensions as standards to their user community. If no `ns` is provided, the name is expected to be in the \"OSCAL\" namespace.\n\nTo ensure a `ns` is unique to an organization and naming conflicts are avoided, a URI containing a DNS or other globally defined organization name should be used. For example, if FedRAMP and DoD both extend OSCAL, FedRAMP will use the `ns` `http://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal`, while DoD might use the `ns` `https://defense.gov` for any organization specific `name`.\n\nTools that process OSCAL content are not required to interpret unrecognized OSCAL extensions; however, OSCAL compliant tools should not modify or remove unrecognized extensions, unless there is a compelling reason to do so, such as data sensitivity.",

This allows a system security plan processor to use the baseline as a catalog of controls.\n\nWhile it is possible to reference a previously resolved OSCAL profile as a catalog, this practice is discouraged since the unresolved form of the profile communicates more information about selections and changes to the underlying catalog. Furthermore, the underlying catalog can be maintained separately from the profile, which also has maintenance advantages for distinct maintainers, ensuring that the best available information is produced through profile resolution.",
