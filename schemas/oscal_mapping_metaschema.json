The `relationship` type and the `matching-rationale` must be used together. However, more than one `matching-rationale` method may apply to a `source` and `target` pair.\n\nFor example, consider the CSF 1.1's PR.AC-1, \"Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorized devices, users and processes\", and the Privacy Framework's PR.AC-P1, \"Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, and devices.\"\n\nThese two requirements have identical wording except for \"users\" versus \"individuals\" and the order of the last few words. With a \\`matching-rationale\\` of syntactic, the relationship type would beintersects with because the two overlap, but each includes content that the other does not. However, with a rationale of semantic, the relationship type would be equal if \"users\" and \"individuals\" have the same meaning in their respective sources, subset if \"users\" was a subset of \"individuals,\" and so on.\n\nWhen establishing relationships, mapping SHOULD be done at the control statement level where possible.

The `relationship` type and the `matching-rationale` must be used together. However, more than one `matching-rationale` method may apply to a `source` and `target` pair.\n\nFor example, consider the CSF 1.1's PR.AC-1, \"Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorized devices, users and processes\", and the Privacy Framework's PR.AC-P1, \"Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, and devices.\"\n\nThese two requirements have identical wording except for \"users\" versus \"individuals\" and the order of the last few words. With a \\`matching-rationale\\` of syntactic, the relationship type would beintersects with because the two overlap, but each includes content that the other does not. However, with a rationale of semantic, the relationship type would be equal if \"users\" and \"individuals\" have the same meaning in their respective sources, subset if \"users\" was a subset of \"individuals,\" and so on.\n\nWhen establishing relationships, mapping SHOULD be done at the control statement level where possible.
