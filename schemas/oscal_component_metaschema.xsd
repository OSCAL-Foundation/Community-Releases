         <p>The OSCAL Component Definition Model can be used to describe the implementation of controls in a <code>component</code> or a set of components grouped as a <code>capability</code>. A component can be either a <em>technical component</em> , or a <em>documentary component</em>.</p>
         <p>A technical component is a component that is implemented in hardware (physical or virtual) or software. Suppliers may document components in an OSCAL component definition that describes the implementation of controls in their hardware and software.</p>
         <p>A documentary component is a component implemented for a documented process, procedure, or policy. Suppliers may document components in an OSCAL component definition that describes the implementation of controls in their process, procedure, or policy.</p>
         <p>The information provided by a technical or documentary component can be used by component consumers to provide starting narratives for documenting control implementations in an OSCAL SSP.</p>
         <p>The root of the OSCAL Implementation Layer Component Definition model is <code>component-definition</code>.</p>

            <p><b>Document Metadata</b>: Provides information about the containing document, and defines concepts that are shared across the document.</p>
            <p>All OSCAL documents use the same metadata structure, that provides a consistent way of expressing OSCAL document metadata across all OSCAL models. The metadata section also includes declarations of individual objects (i.e., roles, location, parties) that may be referenced within and across linked OSCAL documents.</p>
            <p>The metadata in an OSCAL document has few required fields, representing only the bare minimum data needed to differentiate one instance from another. Tools and users creating OSCAL documents may choose to use any of the optional fields, as well as extension mechanisms (e.g., properties, links) to go beyond this minimum to suit their use cases.</p>
            <p>A publisher of OSCAL content can use the <code>published</code>, <code>last-modified</code>, and <code>version</code> fields to establish information about an individual in a sequence of successive revisions of a given OSCAL-based publication. The metadata for a previous revision can be represented as a <code>revision</code> within this object. Links may also be provided using the <code>predecessor-version</code> and <code>successor-version</code> link relations to provide for direct access to the related resource. These relations can be provided as a link child of this object or as <code>link</code> within a given <code>revision</code>.</p>
            <p>A <code>responsible-party</code> entry in this context refers to roles and parties that have responsibility relative to the production, review, publication, and use of the containing document.</p>

Ideally, this field will be managed by the editing tool or service used to make modifications when storing the modified document.</p>

                  <p><b>Document Metadata</b>: Provides information about the containing document, and defines concepts that are shared across the document.</p>
                  <p>All OSCAL documents use the same metadata structure, that provides a consistent way of expressing OSCAL document metadata across all OSCAL models. The metadata section also includes declarations of individual objects (i.e., roles, location, parties) that may be referenced within and across linked OSCAL documents.</p>
                  <p>The metadata in an OSCAL document has few required fields, representing only the bare minimum data needed to differentiate one instance from another. Tools and users creating OSCAL documents may choose to use any of the optional fields, as well as extension mechanisms (e.g., properties, links) to go beyond this minimum to suit their use cases.</p>
                  <p>A publisher of OSCAL content can use the <code>published</code>, <code>last-modified</code>, and <code>version</code> fields to establish information about an individual in a sequence of successive revisions of a given OSCAL-based publication. The metadata for a previous revision can be represented as a <code>revision</code> within this object. Links may also be provided using the <code>predecessor-version</code> and <code>successor-version</code> link relations to provide for direct access to the related resource. These relations can be provided as a link child of this object or as <code>link</code> within a given <code>revision</code>.</p>
                  <p>A <code>responsible-party</code> entry in this context refers to roles and parties that have responsibility relative to the production, review, publication, and use of the containing document.</p>

            <p>Properties permit the deployment and management of arbitrary controlled values, within OSCAL objects. A property can be included for any purpose useful to an application or implementation. Typically, properties will be used to sort, filter, select, order, and arrange OSCAL content objects, to relate OSCAL objects to one another, or to associate an OSCAL object to class hierarchies, taxonomies, or external authorities. Thus, the lexical composition of properties may be constrained by external processes to ensure consistency.</p>
            <p>Property allows for associated remarks that describe why the specific property value was applied to the containing object, or the significance of the value in the context of the containing object.</p>

                  <p>Properties permit the deployment and management of arbitrary controlled values, within OSCAL objects. A property can be included for any purpose useful to an application or implementation. Typically, properties will be used to sort, filter, select, order, and arrange OSCAL content objects, to relate OSCAL objects to one another, or to associate an OSCAL object to class hierarchies, taxonomies, or external authorities. Thus, the lexical composition of properties may be constrained by external processes to ensure consistency.</p>

               <p><b>Media Type</b>: A label that indicates the nature of a resource, as a data serialization or format.</p>
               <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">Media Types Registry</a> defines a standardized set of media types, which may be used here.</p>
               <p>The <code>application/oscal+xml</code>, <code>application/oscal+json</code> or <code>application/oscal+yaml</code> media types SHOULD be used when referencing OSCAL XML, JSON, or YAML resources respectively.</p>
               <p>**Note: There is no official media type for YAML at this time.** OSCAL documents should specify <code>application/yaml</code> for general YAML content, or <code>application/oscal+yaml</code> for YAML-based OSCAL content. This approach aligns with use of a structured name suffix, per <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6838.html#section-4.2.8">RFC 6838 Section 4.2.8</a>.</p>
               <p>Some earlier OSCAL content incorporated the model into the media type. For example: <code>application/oscal.catalog+xml</code>. This practice SHOULD be avoided, since the OSCAL model can be detected by parsing the initial content of the referenced resource.</p>

When multiple <code>rlink</code> and <code>base64</code> items are included for a given resource, all items must contain equivalent information. This allows the document consumer to choose a preferred item to process based on a the selected item's <code>media-type</code>. This is extremely important when the items represent OSCAL content that is represented in alternate formats (i.e., XML, JSON, YAML), allowing the same OSCAL data to be processed from any of the available formats indicated by the items.</p>
                  <p>When a resource includes a citation, then the <code>title</code> and <code>citation</code> properties must both be included.</p>
                  <p>A resource can be used in two ways. 1) it may point to an specific retrievable network resource using a <code>rlink</code>, or 2) it may be included as an attachment using a <code>base64</code>.

                  <p>Properties permit the deployment and management of arbitrary controlled values, within OSCAL objects. A property can be included for any purpose useful to an application or implementation. Typically, properties will be used to sort, filter, select, order, and arrange OSCAL content objects, to relate OSCAL objects to one another, or to associate an OSCAL object to class hierarchies, taxonomies, or external authorities. Thus, the lexical composition of properties may be constrained by external processes to ensure consistency.</p>

               <p>The <code>media-type</code> provides a hint about the content model of the referenced resource. A valid entry from the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">IANA Media Types registry</a> SHOULD be used.</p>

               <p>**Note: There is no official media type for YAML at this time.** OSCAL documents should specify <code>application/yaml</code> for general YAML content, or <code>application/oscal+yaml</code> for YAML-based OSCAL content. This approach aligns with use of a structured name suffix, per <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6838.html#section-4.2.8">RFC 6838 Section 4.2.8</a>.</p>
               <p>Some earlier OSCAL content incorporated the model into the media type. For example: <code>application/oscal.catalog+xml</code>. This practice SHOULD be avoided, since the OSCAL model can be detected by parsing the initial content of the referenced resource.</p>

            <p>A resource can be used in two ways. 1) it may point to an specific retrievable network resource using a <code>rlink</code>, or 2) it may be included as an attachment using a <code>base64</code>. A resource may contain multiple <code>rlink</code> and <code>base64</code> entries that represent alternative download locations (rlink) and attachments (base64) for the same resource.</p>
            <p>Both rlink and base64 allow for a <code>media-type</code> to be specified, which is used to distinguish between different representations of the same resource (e.g., Microsoft Word, PDF). When multiple <code>rlink</code> and <code>base64</code> items are included for a given resource, all items must contain equivalent information. This allows the document consumer to choose a preferred item to process based on a the selected item's <code>media-type</code>. This is extremely important when the items represent OSCAL content that is represented in alternate formats (i.e., XML, JSON, YAML), allowing the same OSCAL data to be processed from any of the available formats indicated by the items.</p>
            <p>When a resource includes a citation, then the <code>title</code> and <code>citation</code> properties must both be included.</p>

                  <p>Properties permit the deployment and management of arbitrary controlled values, within OSCAL objects. A property can be included for any purpose useful to an application or implementation. Typically, properties will be used to sort, filter, select, order, and arrange OSCAL content objects, to relate OSCAL objects to one another, or to associate an OSCAL object to class hierarchies, taxonomies, or external authorities. Thus, the lexical composition of properties may be constrained by external processes to ensure consistency.</p>
                  <p>Property allows for associated remarks that describe why the specific property value was applied to the containing object, or the significance of the value in the context of the containing object.</p>

                  <p>Properties permit the deployment and management of arbitrary controlled values, within OSCAL objects. A property can be included for any purpose useful to an application or implementation. Typically, properties will be used to sort, filter, select, order, and arrange OSCAL content objects, to relate OSCAL objects to one another, or to associate an OSCAL object to class hierarchies, taxonomies, or external authorities. Thus, the lexical composition of properties may be constrained by external processes to ensure consistency.</p>
                  <p>Property allows for associated remarks that describe why the specific property value was applied to the containing object, or the significance of the value in the context of the containing object.</p>

            <p>A document identifier provides an additional data point for identifying a document that can be assigned by a publisher or organization for purposes in a wider system, such as a digital object identifier (DOI) or a local content management system identifier.</p>
            <p>Use of a document identifier allows for document creators to associate sets of documents that are related in some way by the same <code>document-id</code>.</p>
            <p>An OSCAL document always has an implicit document identifier provided by the document's UUID, defined by the <code>uuid</code> on the top-level object. Having a default UUID-based identifier ensures all documents can be minimally identified when other document identifiers are not provided.</p>
