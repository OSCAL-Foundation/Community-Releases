      "description" : "A partition of an assessment plan or results or a child of another part.\n\nA `part` provides for logical partitioning of prose, and can be thought of as a grouping structure (e.g., section). A `part` can have child parts allowing for arbitrary nesting of prose content (e.g., statement hierarchy). A `part` can contain `prop` objects that allow for enriching prose text with structured name/value information.\n\nA `part` can be assigned an optional `id`, which allows for internal and external references to the textual concept contained within a `part`. A `id` provides a means for an OSCAL profile, or a higher layer OSCAL model to reference a specific part within a `catalog`. For example, an `id` can be used to reference or to make modifications to a control statement in a profile.\n\nUse of `part` and `prop` provides for a wide degree of extensibility within the OSCAL catalog model. The optional `ns` provides a means to qualify a part's `name`, allowing for organization-specific vocabularies to be defined with clear semantics. Any organization that extends OSCAL in this way should consistently assign a `ns` value that represents the organization, making a given namespace qualified `name` unique to that organization. This allows the combination of `ns` and `name` to always be unique and unambiguous, even when mixed with extensions from other organizations. Each organization is responsible for governance of their own extensions, and is strongly encouraged to publish their extensions as standards to their user community. If no `ns` is provided, the name is expected to be in the \"OSCAL\" namespace.\n\nTo ensure a `ns` is unique to an organization and naming conflicts are avoided, a URI containing a DNS or other globally defined organization name should be used. For example, if FedRAMP and DoD both extend OSCAL, FedRAMP will use the `ns` `http://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal`, while DoD might use the `ns` `https://defense.gov` for any organization specific `name`.\n\nTools that process OSCAL content are not required to interpret unrecognized OSCAL extensions; however, OSCAL compliant tools should not modify or remove unrecognized extensions, unless there is a compelling reason to do so, such as data sensitivity.",

A `part` can have child parts allowing for arbitrary nesting of prose content (e.g., statement hierarchy). A `part` can contain `prop` objects that allow for enriching prose text with structured name/value information.\n\nA `part` can be assigned an optional `id`, which allows references to this part from within a catalog, or within an instance of another OSCAL model that has a need to reference the part. Examples of where part referencing is used in OSCAL include:\n\n- Referencing a part by id to tailor (make modifications to) a control statement in a profile.\n- Referencing a control statement represented by a part in a system security plan implemented-requirement where a statement-level response is desired.\n\nUse of `part` and `prop` provides for a wide degree of extensibility within the OSCAL catalog model. The optional `ns` provides a means to qualify a part's `name`, allowing for organization-specific vocabularies to be defined with clear semantics. Any organization that extends OSCAL in this way should consistently assign a `ns` value that represents the organization, making a given namespace qualified `name` unique to that organization. This allows the combination of `ns` and `name` to always be unique and unambiguous, even when mixed with extensions from other organizations. Each organization is responsible for governance of their own extensions, and is strongly encouraged to publish their extensions as standards to their user community. If no `ns` is provided, the name is expected to be in the \"OSCAL\" namespace.\n\nTo ensure a `ns` is unique to an organization and naming conflicts are avoided, a URI containing a DNS or other globally defined organization name should be used. For example, if FedRAMP and DoD both extend OSCAL, FedRAMP will use the `ns` `http://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal`, while DoD might use the `ns` `https://defense.gov` for any organization specific `name`.\n\nTools that process OSCAL content are not required to interpret unrecognized OSCAL extensions; however, OSCAL compliant tools should not modify or remove unrecognized extensions, unless there is a compelling reason to do so, such as data sensitivity.",
