# Community-Releases
This is a TEMPORARY holding repository for OSCAL Community releases while we investigate options. The content in this repo should be considered experimental and for testing purposes only.

The included "OSCAL-CLI" tool is from this third-party repository: https://github.com/metaschema-framework/oscal-cli and is included here at the 2.5.1 release version to simplify execution. The metaschema files are taken from the main branch of the OSCAL repository, except for the mapping model, which is taken from the prototype mapping model branch.
